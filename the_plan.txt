What the game is:
     robot swarm - vs bunny swarm;
     rouge-like-lite (assumed death of swarm in a run - upgrades based on how far you got in the run);
     prestige system (reset the game for a bonus / reward); 
     puzzle based, combat optional : solve puzzles with the robot swarm
     2D sidescroller - tiled rooms linked together randomly.
     push you luck elements - further down a level or cash out?


what is the story:
     meta:    
     plot: robots are good, bunnies are evil. aliens are behind it. 
     characters: "robot swarm", "bunny swarm"

     write story - expand details;
     functionally balance robots as much as possible (make them useful at different puzzles)

     design UI (temp)
     swarm count / management for health and collision detection design
     (probably sooner than later:) physics optimization for large number of colliding entites;
     state management solution (do we want a redux-like store for game state?)

     fine tune UI:
          -(can we do anything better than a wow style bottom bar?);
     itereate
          -fine tune basic game play 
          -make sure is fun.

Weston Says :
{
     Make swarm move
     make swarm make formations that can be used in puzzles
     bots comes from differetn materials
     grind materials to get different bots 
     different bots allow for different 

     Bot Ideas: Ferral bots that can attach to animals
                glue bots: help make different formations
                bouncing boomers: bots that explode on contact
                Shiny bots: reflect light ,light source can make laser
                turret bot: weak advancing turret bots fighters til the end fire at everything 

     seperate your swarm cancel Last cancel ALL
     main enemy is a swarm of bunnnies
     bunny that is trying to save the world
     bunny that is solve starvation
     SPIDER BUNNY
     Aliens talking Aliens are neutral 	
     are bots are safe in destructive enviroments but seemingly passive peaceful enviornments kill us
