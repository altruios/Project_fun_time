// generator for rooms that link together properly
      

first steps:
// learn library;

     //some combo of :
          vscode live share:
          git:
          //such as pr->ðŸ˜ ?(ls=>âˆš):âˆš as a gist

// make sprites move; -- done
// make colision happen; --done 
// have some kind particle effect --working one;
// have a scene change --got multiple scenes (which act as containers to code)
// have some kind of animation;

//youtube tutorial(s) watched - goes over most everying - (play in 2x speed and skip around as needed)
//change as needed;

     Make swarm move
     make swarm make formations that can be used in puzzles
     bots comes from differetn materials
     grind materials to get different bots 
     different bots allow for different 

     Bot Ideas: Ferral bots that can attach to animals
                glue bots: help make different formations
                bouncing boomers: bots that explode on contact
                Shiny bots: reflect light ,light source can make laser
                turret bot: weak advancing turret bots fighters til the end fire at everything 
		
     
     seperate your swarm cancel Last cancel ALL
     main enemy is a swarm of bunnnies
     bunny that is trying to save the world
     bunny that is solve starvation

     Aliens talking Aliens are neutral 	
     are bots are safe in destructive enviroments but seemingly passive peaceful enviornments kill us
